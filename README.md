# Homo-sapiens
WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2024 Distinguished Winner
I found myself struggling with studying history and social studies which are the most challenging subjects I've encountered in my school years, especially evident during my grade 11 when our entire class failed the subject. Believing interactive lessons are crucial for effective learning, I decided to develop an application aimed at teaching basic history to kids aged 8-12, laying a solid foundation. Starting from the basics of human evolution with the application “Homo sapiens”.
