# Homo-sapiens
WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2024 Distinguished Winner

I found myself struggling with studying history and social studies which are the most challenging subjects I've encountered in my school years, especially evident during my grade 11 when our entire class failed the subject. Believing interactive lessons are crucial for effective learning, I decided to develop an application aimed at teaching basic history to kids aged 8-12, laying a solid foundation. Starting from the basics of human evolution with the application “Homo sapiens”.

# Features and Technologies
Firstly, starting from the initial-evolution, the loading-view showcases an animation using a timer, and the Big-Bang video serves as a prologue.
All levels incorporate a text-to-speech-function to assist children in pronouncing the name of each evolutionary stage. This feature was implemented following the first-user-group test. Catchy tunes are played during the stages to create a fun atmosphere using AVFoundation.
• Australopithecus, the first-stage of evolution, offers a 15-puzzle-game created using SwiftUI framework, making the game a bit challenging, and creative.
• In the Homo-habilis-stage, children learn to create flake-tools. A drag-gesture simulates the action of rock-striking.
• Homo-erectus teaches children to create fire. Essential steps, including branch-cutting and rock-striking, utilizing tapCount and drag-gesture to simulate the action.
• In the Homo-neanderthalensis-stage, individuals enjoy associating with others while hunting. This situation is simulated using the speech-to-text-function, utilizing Speech and AVFoundation to call others to join hunting. Additionally, a Cave-Art-function, is provided to make the moment memorable, utilizing PencilKit for drawing-tools.
• Homo-sapiens-sapiens, the final-stage of evolution, offers a creative feature. As this is the last-evolution, children are given the opportunity to take a selfie as a memento. Their image then appears in the info-view instead of a graphic, utilizing the front-camera.
